# **Spots**

### A clean, modern, responsive photo‑sharing web experience

## ✨ **Overview**

**Spots** is a visually rich, responsive web interface inspired by modern photo‑sharing platforms. Built directly from a detailed Figma specification, this project emphasizes layout precision, typography consistency, component reuse, and adaptive design across all major screen sizes.

This project demonstrates professional front‑end execution using semantic HTML, modular CSS (BEM), and thoughtful asset optimization—resulting in a smooth, polished user experience.
